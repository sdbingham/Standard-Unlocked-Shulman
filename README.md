# Standard-Unlocked

This repository contains everything you need to realize enterprise-grade Salesforce CICD practices without making an enterprise-grade investment. 

The included [Github Actions](.github/workflows) provide a standardized (and mostly automated!) framework for building, testing, and delivering solutions in a consistent and repeatable manner. 

We strongly advocate adhering to a "Release Train" development methodology for Salesforce development. When applied with discipline, this approach consistently balances business demands, development rigor, and the unique constraints of working with Salesforce metadata significantly better than other popular methodologies (Scrum 👀).

## Getting Started

1. Fork this repository.
2. Make a _new_ Repository in your organization and select your fork as the `Repository Template`
3. Modify the `name` and `name_managed` fields in [cumulusci.yml](cumulusci.yml)<sup>1</sup>
4. Follow the [`Initial Setup` instructions](https://github.com/Nimba-Solutions/Standard-Unlocked/blob/main/.github/workflows/README.md#initial-setup) to configure the included CICD for this project.

> [!NOTE]
> 1. As you explore this project, you may notice a large number of tokens such as     `__PROJECT_LABEL__` and `__PROJECT_NAME__`. These correspond to the `name_managed` and `name` attributes in [cumulusci.yml](cumulusci.yml), and will be automatically exchanged via *token injection* when running CCI commands.

## Development

1. [Set up CumulusCI](https://cumulusci.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html) in your preferred development environnment.
2. Run `cci flow run dev_org --org dev` to deploy this project.
3. Run `cci org browser dev` to open the org in your browser.
4. Build your solution, periodically run `cci task run retrieve_changes --org dev`, and commit your changes to a `feature/**` branch using your preferred git tooling.
7. When you're ready, run `git push` to send your changes to GitHub.
