# This workflow generates a new Beta Package Version and installs it into a Validation Org.
# It also generates a corresponding Github Release and Tag.
# Beta Package Versions can only be installed into scratch orgs and sandboxes.
# To enable it for production installation you need to run the `Beta (Unlocked) - Promote` workflow.
