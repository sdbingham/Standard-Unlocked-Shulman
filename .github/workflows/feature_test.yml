# This workflow generates a FEATURE TEST PACKAGE from the latest Commit SHA.
# It only serves to validate the deployment and packageability of the latest commit.
# It does NOT affect the version of the package and is not included in the package ancestry.
# To generate a new Beta Package Version, you need to run the `Beta (Unlocked) - Create` workflow.
